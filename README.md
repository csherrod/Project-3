# Project-3

## Before I get to answering some of the question regarding the project
* Along with the research of creating a good game and figuring out what tech stack would work best for this type of application we really need to more clearly define what kind of features we need to have to obtain our “MVP”. I think defining that really supersedes everything. I don’t want to get bogged down in doing unnecessary research while we haven’t crystalized what we want the end product to be. 

* First off, the real stock market is enormously complex. Basically you have stocks, bonds, commodities, options and futures and each one of these categories has thousands upon thousands of investment options within them.

* There’s more than one exchange that lists these investment products for sale to the public.

* Let’s just look at a stocks for a second. 



## Tech Questions
--------------
### What tech stack should we use and why? 
* MERN - because that's what we need to be able to build when we graduate and having a complete MERN app would be great.
* It seems like a lot of financial analysis is done in python but I don't know how much actual analysis we will need to be able to do.
* I still need to do more research but it seems like integrating GraphQL would be beneficial for our app

### What deployment options are there? What are the benefits of the deployment options?
* I think we should try to do AWS

### Who are the competitors? What do they do well? What problems do they have?

### What APIs may benefit for a stock market game?

### What industry related algorithms would we need to use?

# App Idea Questions
------------------

### Benefits of real-world scenarios?
* Users will learn how to actually invest and save money for retirement
### What are the features of a game? How does the theme of a stock market change that?
* Entertaining, engaging, fun, educational. Think of the stock market like gambling. It costs money to play, they're a lot of math involved, there's skill involved, there's stategy, you can lose your money pretty quick if you don't know what you're doing and you can win a lot of money by doing nothing right and just getting lucky

### What legalities play into a stock market game? Into a web application?
* Any web application that stores user data has some legalities to it. I think what kind of different legal questions we might need to ask will depend on what we want our web app to do with the data and how we monetize it. 
### What are the rules for various stock/currency exchanges across the world?
* I don't think we need to worry about the world and all the different exchanges just yet. Let's decide what we want our app to do and then we can look into that. 

### How complicated do we want the game to be?
* Not complicated at all. People won't stick around to play it if it's to complicated to get started.

### Who is our target audience?
* People who don't know anything about investing and want to learn the basics.

### How do we hook people and then eventually make money?
* You need to start out with enough money to make it interesting.
* Give the user friends that we make so they can get tips and see different investment strategies.
* If the user starts losing money maybe our friends our doing well enough to give them some charity to keep them interested.

### Viability of the idea as a money making model?
* Hinges on how addictive you can make the game.

### What would our pricing/business model look like?
* Since most games are free to play these days I don't think we can sell the game.
* I think selling ads might be a way to make some money.
